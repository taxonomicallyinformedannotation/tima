\usage{
clean_bio(annot_table_wei_bio, edges_table, minimal_consistency)
}
\arguments{
\item{annot_table_wei_bio}{Data frame containing biologically weighted annotations}

\item{edges_table}{Data frame containing network edges between features}

\item{minimal_consistency}{Numeric minimum consistency score (0-1) required
to retain a classification at each taxonomic level}
}
\value{
Data frame containing filtered biologically weighted annotations
with consistency scores
}
\description{
This function cleans and filters biologically weighted
annotation results by calculating chemical consistency scores across
network neighbors. Only features with at least 2 neighbors are evaluated.
Internal helper for weight_annotations().
