\title{Sanitize spectra}
\usage{
sanitize_spectra(spectra, cutoff = NULL, dalton = 0.01, ppm = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{Spectra object from the Spectra package}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric absolute minimal intensity threshold (default: NULL).
Peaks below this intensity are removed. If NULL, a dynamic threshold
based on each spectrum's intensity distribution will be used.}

\item{dalton}{Numeric Dalton tolerance for peak matching (default: 0.01)}

\item{ppm}{Numeric PPM tolerance for peak matching (default: 10)}
}
\value{
A sanitized Spectra object with noise and artifacts removed
}
\description{
This function sanitizes MS spectra by removing noise, artifacts,
precursor peaks, and empty spectra. It applies multiple cleaning steps
including intensity filtering, peak reduction, and normalization.
