\title{Filter edges for consistency calculation}
\usage{
.filter_edges_for_consistency(edges_table, min_neighbors = 2L, min_entropy = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges_table}{Data frame containing network edges}

\item{min_neighbors}{Integer minimum number of neighbors required (default: 2)}

\item{min_entropy}{Numeric minimum spectral entropy (default: 0)}
}
\value{
Filtered edges data frame
}
\description{
Filters edges to keep only features with at least 2 neighbors and
removes self-loops. Optionally filters by spectral entropy and labels.
}
\note{
TODO: Implement more sophisticated filtering criteria:
\itemize{
\item Configurable entropy thresholds for spectral quality
\item Similarity score minimums
\item Consider edge filtering during edge creation step
}
