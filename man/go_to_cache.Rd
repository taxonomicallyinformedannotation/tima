\title{Go to Cache Directory}
\usage{
go_to_cache(dir = ".tima")
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Character string name of the cache directory (default: ".tima").
Will be created in the user's home directory. Must be non-empty.}
}
\value{
Character string path to the cache directory (invisibly).
Changes working directory as side effect.
}
\description{
Creates a cache directory in the user's home directory (if it
doesn't already exist) and changes the working directory to it. This is
useful for storing temporary files, intermediate results, and downloaded
data in a consistent location across sessions.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
\item Validates the cache directory name
\item Constructs the full path in the user's home directory
\item Creates the directory if it doesn't exist
\item Changes the working directory to the cache location
\item Logs all operations for debugging
}

The cache directory is created with appropriate permissions and will persist
across R sessions until explicitly deleted.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create and navigate to default cache directory (~/.tima)
go_to_cache()

# Use custom cache directory name
go_to_cache(dir = ".my_project_cache")

# Store the cache path for reference
cache_path <- go_to_cache()
print(cache_path)
}
}
