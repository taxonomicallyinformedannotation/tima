\usage{
run_tima(
  target_pattern = "^ann_wei$",
  log_file = "tima.log",
  clean_old_logs = TRUE,
  log_level = "info"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_pattern}{Character. Regex pattern for target selection.
Default: "^ann_wei$" (annotation preparation target)}

\item{log_file}{Character. Path to log file. Default: "tima.log"}

\item{clean_old_logs}{Logical. Remove old log file before starting.
Default: TRUE}

\item{log_level}{Character or numeric. Logging verbosity level.
Can be one of: "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal"
or numeric values: TRACE=600, DEBUG=500, INFO=400, WARN=300, ERROR=200, FATAL=100.
Default: "info" (400). Use "debug" for detailed troubleshooting.}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. Executes workflow as side effect and creates
timestamped log files in data/processed/
}
\description{
Executes the full Taxonomically Informed Metabolite Annotation (TIMA)
workflow from start to finish. This includes data preparation, library loading,
annotation, weighting, and output generation. The function runs the targets
pipeline and archives logs with timestamps for reproducibility.
}
\details{
The workflow performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Initializes logging and timing
\item Navigates to cache directory
\item Executes the targets pipeline (annotation preparation)
\item Archives timestamped logs to data/processed/
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run full workflow with defaults (INFO level)
run_tima()

# Run with debug logging for troubleshooting
run_tima(log_level = "debug")

# Run with minimal logging (warnings and errors only)
run_tima(log_level = "warn")

# Run with custom target pattern
run_tima(target_pattern = "^prepare_")

# Preserve existing logs
run_tima(clean_old_logs = FALSE)

# Combine multiple options
run_tima(
  target_pattern = "^ann_",
  log_level = "debug",
  clean_old_logs = FALSE
)
}
}
