\title{Load Edges Table with Neighbor Filtering}
\usage{
load_edges_table(edges, candidates_neighbors)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{Character, path to edges file.}

\item{candidates_neighbors}{Integer, number of top neighbors to keep per feature.}
}
\value{
Data frame with filtered edges (top \code{candidates_neighbors} per \code{feature_source}).
}
\description{
Internal helper to load the edges file and retain only the top N
neighbors (by similarity score) for each feature. This reduces complexity
for downstream annotation propagation and scoring.
