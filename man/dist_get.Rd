\title{Get distance between two elements}
\usage{
dist_get(d, idx1, idx2)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Distance matrix or dist object}

\item{idx1}{Integer index of the first element (1-based)}

\item{idx2}{Integer index of the second element (1-based)}
}
\value{
Numeric distance between the two elements.
Returns 0 if indices are identical.
Returns NA if indices are out of bounds (with warning).
}
\description{
Calculates the distance between two elements in a distance
matrix by their indices. Optimized for repeated lookups.

# Create distance matrix
data_mat <- matrix(rnorm(20), nrow = 5)
d <- dist(data_mat)

# Get distance between elements 1 and 3
dist_get(d, 1, 3)

# Distance to self is 0
dist_get(d, 2, 2)
