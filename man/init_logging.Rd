\title{Initialize logging from environment}
\usage{
init_logging()
}
\value{
NULL (invisibly)
}
\description{
Convenience wrapper to configure logging based on environment
variables. Safe to call multiple times (idempotent).
}
\details{
Environment variables:
\itemize{
\item TIMA_LOG_FILE: Path to log file (default: "tima.log")
\item TIMA_LOG_LEVEL: TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR (default: DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL)
}

This function is automatically called on first use of any logging function,
so explicit initialization is optional. However, you can call it explicitly
to customize logging before any messages are logged.
