\value{
Data frame with chemically weighted annotations including chemical
consistency scores and final weighted scores
}
\description{
Weights biologically weighted annotations according to their
chemical consistency by comparing chemical taxonomy (ClassyFire,
NPClassifier) across molecular network neighbors. Higher chemical
consistency within network components results in higher chemical scores.
}
\details{
The weights are automatically normalized by dividing by their sum,
so they do NOT need to sum to 1. For example, weights of (1, 1, 1)
produce the same result as (0.33, 0.33, 0.33).
