\arguments{
\item{input}{Query file containing spectra. Currently an '.mgf' file}

\item{library}{Library containing spectra to match against. Can be '.mgf' or '.sqlite' (Spectra formatted)}

\item{polarity}{MS polarity. Must be 'pos' or 'neg'.}

\item{output}{Output file.}

\item{method}{Method to be used to perform spectral comparison}

\item{threshold}{Minimal similarity to report}

\item{ppm}{Relative ppm tolerance to be used}

\item{dalton}{Absolute Dalton tolerance to be used}

\item{npeaks}{Absolute minimum number of peaks to be matched}

\item{rpeaks}{Relative minimum number of peaks to be matched}

\item{condition}{Condition to be fulfilled. Either 'OR' or 'AND' (mass and peaks minima).}

\description{
This function performs spectral matching.
}
\details{
It takes two files as input. A query file that will be matched against a library file.
Multiple comparison distances are available
('gnps', 'navdist','ndotproduct','neuclidean', 'nspectraangle' (See MsCoreUtils for details)).
Number of matched peaks and their ratio are also available (See MatchForwardReverseParam for details).
Parallel processing is also made available.
