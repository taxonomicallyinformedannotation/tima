\usage{
minimize_results(
  df,
  features_table,
  min_score_classes = 0.6,
  min_score_compounds = 0.4,
  best_percentile = 0.9
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing full annotation results with scores and
chemical taxonomy predictions}

\item{features_table}{Data frame of features to join with minimized results}

\item{min_score_classes}{Numeric minimum score threshold (0-1) for keeping
chemical classifications (default: 0.6)}

\item{min_score_compounds}{Numeric minimum score threshold (0-1) for keeping
compound identifications (default: 0.4)}

\item{best_percentile}{Numeric percentile threshold (0-1) for selecting top
candidates within each feature (default: 0.9, keeps candidates with scores
>= 90\% of the maximum score for that feature)}
}
\value{
A minimized data frame with features joined to their best chemical
classifications and top compound identifications
}
\description{
This function minimizes annotation results by filtering to the
most confident chemical classifications and compound identifications.
It extracts the best-scoring chemical taxonomy predictions and the top
compound candidates based on weighted chemical scores.
