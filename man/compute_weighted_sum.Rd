\title{Compute normalized weighted sum (row-wise for data frames)}
\usage{
compute_weighted_sum(..., weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Numeric columns/vectors of component values (passed as separate arguments).}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of non-negative weights (one per component).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector: row-wise weighted sum with normalized weights.
}
\description{
Compute normalized weighted sum (row-wise for data frames)
}
\details{
Original formula: (w1\emph{v1 + w2}v2 + ...) / (w1 + w2 + ...)
where w are weights and v are value columns. Weights are normalized to sum to 1.
